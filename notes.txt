2. Set path and enviroment variables Windows 7

Right-click the Computer icon and select Properties. 
Click the Advanced System Settings it on the left hand side.
In the System Properties window, click on the Advanced tab, then click the Environment Variables.
In the Environment Variables window highlight the Path variable in the "System variables" section and click the Edit button. 
Add or modify the path lines with the paths you want the computer to access. 

You can also set the path via the command prompt (search: cmd)
For example I set my path when installing nodejs like this.
If the path is: C:\Program Files\Nodejs do like this.

This string will be set the enviroment variable til you close prompt:
SET PATH=C:\Program Files\Nodejs;%PATH%

This will set the variable for good:
setx path "%path%;C:\Program Files\Nodejs"

3. Getting Gulp to work on Windows 7 

I have had a hard time gettin Gulp and Bower to work on windows, and especially on git bash which I prefer.

The problem was that after installing everything I needed it still gave the error:
$Gulp
sh.exe": Gulp: command not found

$bower
sh.exe": bower: command not found

I got it to work on the command prompt but still would not work in Git BASH until i set a enviroment variable to:
C:\Users\me\AppData\Roaming\npm;

5. Z-index only working in Chrome bug
I had a cross browser bug which involved z-index only not working in Chrome, the solution was to change position to absolute instead of relative.
 
.element {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}

to 

.element {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 1;
}

6. Shy hyphens

If you need a "tag" which will set the dash where you want on line break shy is the answer.

8. Bower update error
After updating Bower i got this message.
-bash: /usr/bin/bower: No such file or directory

After trying different solutions i ended up with just trying to install it again:
sudo npm install -g bower

And it worked like a charm.


9. Vagrant Box stopped working

I got this error after updating homestead.

My solution was to delete current version, installing it again. 
In my case when updating there where 2 box versions, I think this could have been the problem though im not sure.

Open command line and write: 
vagrant box list

to see what boxes you have. In my case this was the result:
laravel/homestead (virtualbox, 0.2.5)
laravel/homestead (virtualbox, 0.2.6)

To delete them you write:
vagrant box remove laravel/homestead --box-version 0.2.5
vagrant box remove laravel/homestead --box-version 0.2.6

After that cd to the homestead folder and write:
vagrant add laravel/homestead

13. CSS vertical align text - 23.06.2015

There are different ways to vertical align text, for example with table.

But I find this as the easiest way, add this to the div. you are trying to align.

In my case:

HTML:
<div class="single-activity">
    <span>Sprint</span>
</div>

CSS:
.single-activity {
height: 45px;
line-height: 45px;
vertical-align: middle;
}

16. Debugging/Freezing Bootstrap tooltips & popover
It can be hard to style certain element because they disappear when you try to click on them.

This is certainly the case with Bootstrap tooltips & popovers, when you try to inspect the element it will disappear.

My solution is to this problem is to make them visible with JavaScript, here is how:

$('[data-toggle="tooltip"]').tooltip('show');

OR

$('[data-toggle="popover"]').popover('show');

then through the developer tool navigate through the HTML to the popover element which in this case will not disappear.


17. Click not working on iPhone

I could not get a click event to fire on an iPhone, it worked on desktop.

Solution: click event needed to be an <a> tag, so I just changed the element to <a> and the event fired perfectly.

Safari can read window.location.hash, but if you need to change hash you need to use window.location.href (twice safari bug).

        } else {
            window.location.href = location.hash;
            window.location.href = location.hash;
        }

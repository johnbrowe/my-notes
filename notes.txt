Difference between = and <=> in MySQL

With <=> operator NULL is like any other value, and has no special meaning.

`'a' <=> 'b'`   returns 0
`'a' <=> 'a'`   returns 1
`NULL = NULL`   returns NULL
`NULL <=> NULL` returns 1
`'a' <=> NULL`  returns NULL

$variable = $date ? $date : 'no date');
echo $variable; // "13-02-2018"

// The shorthand version
$variable = $date ?: 'no date');

Laravel testing date:before fails

Problem: Test fails whatever i do.

Why: Controller test is using `Carbon::setTestNow` and Laravel validation `before` is using strtotime which of course not effected by Carbon time.

Solution: Do not use `Carbon::setTestNow` along with strtotime function.

Mocking a collection Laravel

Cool way to mock an Eleqount query without relying on the DB.

```
$tickets = collect([
    (object) ['price' => 1200],

    (object) ['price' => 1200],
]);
```

All collections items you get when you are using the query builder are instances of PHP stdClass.

Mac OSX system path not working

I was trying to add a new path to the systems path via both /etc/paths and .bash_profile but the terminal would not get it on echo $PATH.

The problem was that I am using a shell called Fish which means that you have to set the systems path another place.

Here is how  I solved it

Create new fish config file:
**$ touch ~/.config/fish/config.fish**


Open config file:
**$ nano ~/.config/fish/config.fish**


Insert path to file:
**ยง echo set -gx PATH \$PATH <path>** 


Then CTRL + X and yes to save, then restart terminal and you a good to go.

UTF-8 encoding in PHP

According to the Podcast PHP Roundtable the best encoding to MySQL is utf8mb4 as this supports all the UTF-8 characters.
* Remember to use `<meta charset="utf-8">` in HTML head. 
* In a form you can use `<form enctype="text/plain; charset=utf-8">`.
* In HTTP use Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8. 
* Always use `<meta>` and a Content-Type header.

Laravel Drop Unique Index

I was trying to drop an unique index via php artisan migrate but got an error which said I could not drop the column  i was trying to remove the unique key from.

This is the failing code:
```php
public function up()
{
	Schema::table('news', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->dropUnique('title');
        });
}

public function down()
{
	Schema::table('news', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->unique('title');
        });
}
````

The problem was I that dropUnique needs a full path/name for the index.

Working example:

```php
public function up()
{
	Schema::table('news', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->dropUnique('news_title_unique');
        });
}

public function down()
{
	Schema::table('news', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->unique('title');
        });
}
```

So dropUnique get first the table "news" then the column "title" and then the unique key "unique" all in all "news_title_unique".

Sometimes you need a callback to be optional.

		cb();
	}
}

crush("stone");

crush("stone", function(){

Undefined offset: 0

Once in a while you get a exception like this one.

ErrorException in Collection.php line 1187:
Undefined offset: 0 (View: /home/vagrant/Code/.../resources/views/.../index.blade.php)

And if this error occurs in Laravel you are quick to panic and run away to Google I know I do.

But most likely this is an error that occurs when you are trying to access a key that does not exists in an array.

Example:

$list = ["Sara", "Tinna", "John"];
echo $list[0]; // "Sara"
echo $list[2]; // "John"
echo $list[3]; // Undefined offset: 3 :4

So just go through your view file at figure out where you are trying to access a key that does not exist.

I tried multiple different installs but nothing really worked.

But I found a solution on SO where it said I should commment out bind_ip = 127.0.0.1 and so I did.

Edit mongod.conf:
sudo nano /etc/mongod.conf

Comment out bind_p:
# bind_ip = 127.0.0.1

Restart MongoDB:
sudo service mongod restart

Here are some other usefull command for debugging MongoDB:
ps -ef | grep mongo
lsof -i -ac mongod
sudo service mongod status

Font-weight not working on Wkhtmltopdf Ubuntu 16.04

After setting my app up in a new server, all my thin and bold fonts where rendering as normal.

Meaning font-weight: 100 and font-weight: 700 would be displayed as font-weight: 500.

I tried different settings and version of the font for about 3 hours before I tried to change the font-weight: 100 to font-weight: lighter and bang it worked.

So the fix was to use lighter, normal and bold instead of 100, 500, 700.

Still not sure why this suddently changed, and I am too tired to look more into this today.

All input not showing on submit

I got a bug on on of my web apps as newly created products where not being sent when I submitted the form.

Every input looked good in the form and I just many many many hours trying to debug this issue.

The problem was PHP has a default security setting that says PHP will not receive more than 1000 input fields. And i was sending about 1100 fields meaning that last 100 input fields would not show up. It just ignores the rest and will not send an error.

If you are using the Apache the fix is simple just add these lines to you .htaccess file.
php_value max_input_vars 6000
php_value suhosin.post.max_vars 6000
php_value suhosin.request.max_vars 6000

And you are good to go.


On Nginx you need to edit the php.ini file, and uncomment the line with max_input_vars and set it to a higher number.

If you are not sure where the php.ini is located just use the phpinfo(); function.

There will be a row called "Loaded Configuration File" which will tell you the path to the php.ini file.

The path will be something like this /etc/php/7.0/php.ini.

So to edit you could use a line like as this.

nano /etc/php/7.0/php.ini

It will look like this:
; max_input_vars = 1000

I changed mine to this:
max_input_vars = 4000

After this you have to restart php process manager with this command:

/etc/init.d/php7.0-fpm restart

Now it should work

Install Node on Ubuntu

After installing apt-get install nodejs.

I could only use node by using command nodejs, which does not work well with Gulp packages.

After reading up on it it seems there is some kind of conflict package on apt-get therefore we need to remove the existing "node" app.  
* sudo apt-get --purge remove node

Also remove nodejs so you can install it again.
* sudo apt-get --purge remove nodejs

Then you can install nodejs again and this time it will react on "node" command
* sudo apt-get install nodejs

Add element after another

I was quite impressed by this JS function insertAdjacentHTML.

It is an easy way to add an element after another, kindof like .after() in jQuery works.

// Create HTML alement
var html = '<button>New button</a>';

// Get slider element
var slider = document.getElementById('slider');

// Insert button after slider element
slider.insertAdjacentHTML('afterend', html);

Quite clean and easy to use. There also other options such as:

'beforebegin' - Before the element
'afterbegin'  - Inside the element, before first child
'beforeend'   - Inside the element, after last child
'afterend'    - After the element

My first extension Chrome extension

I have always wondered how a Chrome extension works.
Now I know.

I needed to set a cookie with an ID onload every time the browser was updated locally to emulate a cloud service.

I found out it is quite simple to setup.

I created a folder called add_cookie with two files:

add_cookie/
	- content.js
	- manifest.js 


In manifest.js I inserted this code:

// Manifest
{
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "name": "Add Cookie Local",
  "version": "0.1",
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": [
        "<all_urls>"
      ],
      "js": ["content.js"]
    }
  ]
}

In content.js is just set the cookie:

// content.js
document.cookie = "Ely_vID=114p93086";


Upload the folder to chrome extension:
settings => Extensions => Load unpacked extension

right to the path to your project directory:
Double click (absolute path on the server)
Write the same path as your homestead.yaml folder to path is: 
example: /home/vagrant/johnhoj  

Then click apply.

99. Apache commands

I always forget these simple commands:

service apache2 start
service apache2 stop
service apache2 restart

----

98. [PDO Exception] Could not find driver - Laravel

I got this exception while trying to set up Laravel on a server.

The solution was to install php5-sqlite, and then it worked perfectly.

sudo apt-get install php5-sqlite

----

97. Mcrypt missing in phpinfo() after install

For some kind of reason Mcrypt was not showing up in phpinfo after install.
It was though located in the mods_available folder.

Solution was to:
cd /etc/php5/mods_available
sudo php5enmod mcrypt 
sudo service apache2 restart

Then it showed up in the phpinfo

96. Vue.js unescape delimiters text trick

Usually itโs done like this:

{{{ data.goes.here }}}

If you for some reason are not able to use the standard escape delimiters in Vue.

You can create your own as I have done here.

Vue.config.unsafeDelimiters = ['{{!', '!}}'];

new Vue({ โฆ })

94. Wrong font in PDF app

As I was working on a PDF app the font thin/100 was behaving wrong, and was being to bold in relation to what I was expecting.

I tried a lot of different ways for improving the rendering of wkhtmltopdf dependency which was rendering my PDFโs.

After hours I wound out that the problem was the font file. The font that I had downloaded should be thin, but was actually regular. So I found a better version of the font which was actually 100/thin and then I worked as it was supposed to.


----

93. SSH without vagrant ssh in Homestead

I was just curious how to login in to the vagrant homestead box without vagrant ssh.

This is how I logged in:
ssh vagrant@127.0.0.1 -p 2222

Key phrase is what ever you added to you public key.
Many times people leave it empty, though I never do this.

----

92. Local font for wkhtmltopdf in Homestead box

I needed to use local fonts on my Laravel PDF app.

For the css to the local fonts you need to create a dir in homestead.

1. cd /usr/share/fonts
2. mkdir Truetype
3. add fonts here

I used font squirrel to convert fonts to the right format.
I just formatted to all formats so I was sure to hit the right one.  

----

91. Copy files to Homestead via SSH

For some kind of reason I was not able to use sftp to login to my Homestead.

I needed to upload some files locally to get my environment to behave as I wanted. So the so solution was to upload via SSH, which is beautiful.

Upload/transfer folder: 
scp -P 2222 -r local/location vagrant@127.0.0.1:/remote/location

Example:
scp -P 2222 -r ~/downloads/fontsfolder vagrant@127.0.0.1:~/.fonts/
scp file.php user@remote.host:~/Code/app


Here are some other examples.

90. Snappy Laravel 4.2 problem (wkhtmltopdf)

I had some problems with getting Snappy Laravel (wkhtmltopdf) to work in my homestead box. Here are the steps to get it working:

1. sudo apt-get install wkhtmltopdf (this will be located at /usr/bin directory)
   # you can cd to the dir example: cd /usr/bin and see if they are installed there		
2. sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf
3. sudo apt-get install openssl build-essential xorg libssl-dev
4. sudo /usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf http://www.google.com test.pdf 
   #Test if this works, in my machine it did not work and I had to do some more steps
5. sudo apt-get install xvfb
6. touch wkhtmltopdf.sh (this should be done in the /usr/bin/ folder)
7. sudo nano wkhtmltopdf.sh
8. add this line: xvfb-run wkhtmltopdf "$@"
9. ctrl + o (to save)
10. ctrl + x (to exit)
11. wkhtmltopdf.sh http://www.google.com test.pdf (should create pdf file named test.pdf)
    # in my case I printed it out to /usr/test.pdf like this, because of permissions
    # wkhtmltopdf.sh http://www.google.com usr/test.pdf			  		
12. Now edit snappy config file mine is located in /app/config/packages/barryvdh/laravel-snappy/config.php
    # In some cases you will get permission denied
13. If so you need to get the wkhtmltopdf.sh permission by writing: chmod +x filename.sh 	

Config.php file should look like this:

<?php

return array(


    'pdf' => array(
        'enabled' => true,
        'binary' => '/usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf.sh',
        'options' => array(),
    ),
    'image' => array(
        'enabled' => true,
        'binary' => '/usr/bin/wkhtmltoimage.sh',
        'options' => array(),
    ),

);

If you donโt have a config read this documentation:
https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-snappy/tree/0.1

This link helped me on the right track.

83.Vue.js component inside component

File structure:
/Vue/app.js
/Vue/Components/parent.js
/Vue/Components/child.js

Here is app file:
new Vue({

    el: "#app",

    components: {
        'parent-component': require('./components/admin/parent')
    }

});


// Parent component file
module.exports = {

    // This is the important part	
    components: {
        'counter': require('./counter')
    },
    ready: function(){}
    data: function () {},
    methods: {}
}

// Child component
module.exports =

{
    template: '<button v-on:click="updateCount">{{ count }}</button>',
    data: function () {
        return { count: 0 }
    }
    methods: {}

<button type="button"></button> // This will not submit

----

77. PHPStorm file encoding

For some reason PHPStorm keept encoding some windows encoding which was kind of annoying.

To get rid of this problem just go to settings -> Editor -> File Encodings Her you can change Ide Encodings, Project Encodings, Default encodings for properties files to UTF-8.

If you want this to be default on all projects do the same thing on "Default Settings".

73. Find object property in Array

Im falling in love with underscore.

I needed to get the index of a name in a object in an array.

And underscore a has many options. I used this:

var users = [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Bob', 'last': 'Brown'},
             {'id': 2, 'name': 'Ted', 'last': 'White'},
             {'id': 3, 'name': 'Frank', 'last': 'James'},
             {'id': 4, 'name': 'Ted', 'last': 'Jones'}];

_.findLastIndex(users, {
  name: 'Ted'
});

// 3

----

72. Vue.js passing args to the event function

HTML should look like this:
<ul id="demo">
  <li v-for="item in items" class="item-{{$index}}" v-on:click.stop.prevent="onClick(item)">
    {{ $index }} - {{ parentMsg }} {{ item.childMsg }}
  </li>
</ul>

Javascript should look like this: 
var demo = new Vue({
  el: '#demo',
  data: {
    parentMsg: 'Hello',
    items: [
      { childMsg: 'Foo' },
      { childMsg: 'Bar' },
      { childMsg: 'bla' },
      { childMsg: 'sma' }
    ]
  },
   methods: {
    onClick: function (obj) {
      console.log(obj.childMsg);
    }
  }
})


As you can see we pass the argument "onclick(item)" which is the same as the v-for item.

71. MySQL workbench alternative

I've been using MySQL workenbench on Windows for a couple of years and it has always suited my needs, 
but lately it has crashed more than my patience could handle. It mainly could not handle large tables.


So I tried out a couple of DB gui's for example Heidi SQL and Navicat.

I had problems with getting Heidi SQL to ssh in into Homestead (my Laravel envirment) so I could not use it.  

Navicat worked perfectly but it's very expensive.

Then I tried SQLWave and for my simple needs it works perfectly, there is nothing it can't handle in my enviroment and it's very easy to work with.

----

70. Vue.js show data

Here is nice snippet for seeing which data you are working with.

'hello '.repeat(3); // 'hello hello hello '


let name = 'Simon';
console.log(`Hello ${name}.`);

67. Xdebug and Homestead

XDebug is fantastic but it is hard to get working.

Just a note last time my problem was absolute path.

I had set the right path to the public folder, my problem was I also needed the absolute path to the root folder.

C:sites/mysite => /home/vagrant/mysite
public => /home/vagrant/mysite/public

65. Reset SSD Ubuntu 15.04

cd /dev/
sudo hdparm -I sda

Then it will show some text, we are interested in this part, specically the part that says frozen:

"
Security: 
	Master password revision code = 65534
		supported
	not	enabled (this should be enabled)
	not	locked
		frozen  (this should be not frozen)
	not	expired: security count
		supported: enhanced erase
	4min for SECURITY ERASE UNIT. 2min for ENHANCED SECURITY ERASE UNIT. 
"

We want it to say not frozen and enabled

To do this write:
systemctl suspend

The system will suspend and then start up again, when it does write "sudo hdparm -I sda" again. 

Now it will say:
not	frozen

Now type to change enabled to not enabled:
sudo hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass A-pass-word sda

Then the cli will display:
security_password="A-pass-word"

If you type sudo "hdparm -I sda" it should say: 

enabled (instead of not    enabled)


Final step, which will wipe the SSD which mean everything on the SSD will be lost, so backup if have something on that want.

Now type:
hdparm --user-master u --security-erase A-pass-word sda

63. Could not ssh into server

I had forgotten all my credentials to a remote server, which I really wanted to log in to. It was a digitalocean server so I could just login to my account and reset the password.

After this I tried to ssh in to the server in any possible way, but I just could not. 

When I wrote ssh root@ip_address

I got "permission denied".

So I figured out problem which was that I tried to ssh in with root and by default login in with root is not permitted. 

To test if this was the case I accessed to web console droplet and wrote:
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

So in this file I changed "PermitRootLogin no" to "PermitRootLogin yes" and then: 

sudo service ssh restart

After this I had not problem loggin in. 

My guess is that there is a reason why root is not permitted login by default, so I changed it back "PermitRootLogin no" and figured out how to create another user.

59. Kill Node process

Usually when you want to quit a node server you press CTRL + C or CTRL + Z.

But if you want to stop the Node server where you have killed of the terminal that you used to start Node.

You get this error if you try to start node again:

Error: listen EADDRINUSE :::3000
    at Object.exports._errnoException (util.js:837:11)
    at exports._exceptionWithHostPort (util.js:860:20)
    at Server._listen2 (net.js:1231:14)
    at listen (net.js:1267:10)
    at Server.listen (net.js:1363:5)
    at EventEmitter.listen (/root/my-site/node_modules/express/lib/application.js:617:24)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/root/my-site/index.js:33:5)
    at Module._compile (module.js:434:26)
    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:452:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:355:32)

You can fix this with:

Write:
ps aux | grep node

Find the process ID, which second from the left (in my case 4 digits) it should look something like this:

root      xxxx  0.0  xx xxxxxx xxxxx pts/0    Sl+  09:18   0:00 node index.js
root      xxxx  0.0  xx  xxxxx   xxx pts/4    S+   09:41   0:00 grep --color=au

Then write:
kill -9 PROCESS_ID

For example:
kill -9 4485


and then you are good to go.

56. SSH - Host key verification failed.

I had just started a new droplet on Digitalocean with an SSH key, but I could not ssh. I keept getting this error.

- Host key verification failed.

This can often be caused of ssh know host, and often I just delete it.

But in this case the problem was more embarrising.

When the question - Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? was set I just pressed ENTER.

This is not enough you must type:

yes (enter)

45. Disable/turn off autosave on PHPStorm

Sometimes auto save does not really work so well with File watchers and you really like the watcher only to react when you hitt Save.

Here is what you do 

Unchecked - Settings / Appearance & Behavior / System Settings / Save file on frame deactivation
Unchecked - Settings / Appearance & Behavior / System Settings / Save files automatically if...
Unchecked - Settings / Editor / General / Editor tabs / Mark modified tabs with asterisk

42. Set path and enviroment variables Windows 7

Right-click the Computer icon and select Properties. 
Click the Advanced System Settings it on the left hand side.
In the System Properties window, click on the Advanced tab, then click the Environment Variables.
In the Environment Variables window highlight the Path variable in the "System variables" section and click the Edit button. 
Add or modify the path lines with the paths you want the computer to access. 

You can also set the path via the command prompt (search: cmd)
For example I set my path when installing nodejs like this.
If the path is: C:\Program Files\Nodejs do like this.

This string will be set the enviroment variable til you close prompt:
SET PATH=C:\Program Files\Nodejs;%PATH%

This will set the variable for good:
setx path "%path%;C:\Program Files\Nodejs"

41. Getting Gulp to work on Windows 7 

I have had a hard time gettin Gulp and Bower to work on windows, and especially on git bash which I prefer.

The problem was that after installing everything I needed it still gave the error:
$Gulp
sh.exe": Gulp: command not found

I had a cross browser bug which involved z-index only not working in Chrome, the solution was to change position to absolute instead of relative.
 
.element {
  position: relative;

}

to 

.element {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 1;
}

36. Bower update error
After updating Bower i got this message.

And it worked like a charm.

35. Vagrant Box stopped working

I got this error after updating homestead.

My solution was to delete current version, installing it again. 
In my case when updating there where 2 box versions, I think this could have been the problem though im not sure.

Open command line and write: 
vagrant box list

to see what boxes you have. In my case this was the result:
laravel/homestead (virtualbox, 0.2.5)
laravel/homestead (virtualbox, 0.2.6)

To delete them you write:
vagrant box remove laravel/homestead --box-version 0.2.5
vagrant box remove laravel/homestead --box-version 0.2.6

After that cd to the homestead folder and write:
vagrant add laravel/homestead

32. CSS vertical align text - 23.06.2015

There are different ways to vertical align text, for example with table.

But I find this as the easiest way, add this to the div. you are trying to align.

In my case:

HTML:
<div class="single-activity">
    <span>Sprint</span>
</div>

CSS:
.single-activity {
height: 45px;
line-height: 45px;
vertical-align: middle;
}

29. Debugging/Freezing Bootstrap tooltips & popover
It can be hard to style certain element because they disappear when you try to click on them.

This is certainly the case with Bootstrap tooltips & popovers, when you try to inspect the element it will disappear.

My solution is to this problem is to make them visible with JavaScript, here is how:

$('[data-toggle="tooltip"]').tooltip('show');

OR

$('[data-toggle="popover"]').popover('show');

then through the developer tool navigate through the HTML to the popover element which in this case will not disappear.

21. Location hash mobile not working

Safari can read window.location.hash, but if you need to change hash you need to use window.location.href (twice safari bug).

            window.location.hash = location.hash;
        } else {
            window.location.href = location.hash;

20. Ubuntu switch keyboard language
In my Ubuntu 14.04 the text entry would not react or do anything, not sure why. It's a good thing we always can rely on the commandline, it's quite much faster as well.

setxkbmap es
or
setxkbmap dk
or
setxkbmap fo



To set it permanently you can do like this

sudo nano /etc/default/keyboard

This will appear:
 
XKBMODEL="pc105"
XKBLAYOUT="us"
XKBVARIANT=""
XKBOPTIONS=""

Then change XKBLAYOUT="**" to the prefered language in my case
XKBLAYOUT="dk"

19. Startcd PhpStorm-133.982/bin

./phpstorm.sh PHPstorm cli Ubuntu
I had problems starting PHPstorm as Ubuntu newbie, but figured it out by cd'ing to the bin directory in the PHP installation and starting the program by using ./ then a launch icon will be added to the desktop launch bar. Now you just right click the the PHPstorm icon a press "lock to launcher"

cd PhpStorm-133.982/bin

./phpstorm.sh 

if you want to start it from home, then:

./PhpStorm-133.982/bin/phpstorm.sh

and to make an alias type this in the terminal;

sudo nano ~/.bashrc

Then usually i go to the bottom the file and write something like this:

#CUSTOM ALIASES - JOHN
alias storm='./PhpStorm-139.1348/bin/phpstorm.sh'
alias phpstorm='./PhpStorm-139.1348/bin/phpstorm.sh'

Then save with:
CTRL+O (then press enter)
CTRL+X (to exit the document)

Then you need to reopen the terminal or just open a new terminal to get it working.

This works for Ubuntu and other unix like systems.
Create a javascript file called something.js

Then go to terminal and cd to the file directory and write:
./something.js

If you want a half screen left press

CTRL + ALT + 6

then you should see something like this "telnet>" and then type
quit

Now the connection should be gone.

10. Change Shopify Checkout style

I was helping a friend with his Shopify page where I had the problem of not being able to change the style of the checkout page.

The page would not react to any styling I tried to add to neither style.css or checkout.css.

Then stumbled on this forum on shopify which lead me to the answer.

Create a new stylesheet and name it checkout.scss.liquid.

And add the changes in there worked very well for me.

When you are using Laravel 5, the form helper is not there by default.

And when you are trying to send a post request you get a 500 error because you need the CSRF token so your form need to look like this:

<form class="form" data-remote action="/search" accept-charset="UTF-8">
  <input name="_token" type="hidden" value="{!! csrf_token() !!}">
  <!-- then the rest of the form input fields -->

Cut(limit string length) string in PHP

As I am usually using blade and other framworks the vanilla PHP templating is not always so sharp.
Here are two functions to cut string.

or 
```
$string = substr($string,0,10).'...';

Accessing illegal name properties from PHP Objects

I quite a long time to figure this one out.

I had a json decoded object where the object keys had some illegal characters "this-is-the-illegal-string".

This mean that the usual way will not work.
```php
$array = ['hello' => 'John', 'hello-world' => 'John'];
$objext = (object)$array;
echo $object->['hello-world']; // This does not work
```

The solution is to use curly braces
```php
echo $object->{'hello-world'}; // This works
```

Express params

I just started using Express and had some problems on how to use params to display pages "blog" pages.

```js
app.get('/notes/:note', function(req, res){

    var notes = require(__dirname + '/pages/content/notes.json');

    res.render(__dirname + '/pages/note', { note: note. [req.params.note]});	

});
```

You will notice that I use the :note after the path /notes/:note

This will catch the unknown params that are added to the path.

You can use this string/value with req.param.note

Note can ofcourse be what ever you want forexample :bla
then you would use req.param.bla to get the value.

Relative CSS link

I typical mistake is to make CSS links relative by not using / at the start of the link.

```html
<link href='css/main.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
```

It should instead be:
```html
<link href='/css/main.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
```

56. SSH - Host key verification failed.

I had just started a new droplet on Digitalocean with an SSH key, but I could not ssh. I keept getting this error.

- Host key verification failed.

This can often be caused of ssh know host, and often I just delete it.

But in this case the problem was more embarrising.

When the question - Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? was set I just pressed ENTER.

This is not enough you must type:

yes (enter)

49. Could not ssh into server

I had forgotten all my credentials to remote server, which I really wanted to log in to. It was a digitalocean server so I could just login to my account and reset the password.

After this I tried to ssh in to the server in any possible way, but I just could not. 

When I wrote ssh root@ip_address

I got "permission denied".

So I figured out problem which was that I tried to ssh in with root and by default login in with root is not permitted. 

To test if this was the case I accessed to web console droplet and wrote:
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

So in this file I changed "PermitRootLogin no" to "PermitRootLogin yes" and then: 

sudo service ssh restart

After this I had not problem loggin in. 

My guess is that there is a reason why root is not permitted login by default, so I changed it back "PermitRootLogin no" and figured out how to create another user.

45. Disable/turn off autosave on PHPStorm

Sometimes auto save does not really work so well with File watchers and you really like the watcher only to react when you hitt Save.

Here is what you do 

Unchecked - Settings / Appearance & Behavior / System Settings / Save file on frame deactivation
Unchecked - Settings / Appearance & Behavior / System Settings / Save files automatically if...
Unchecked - Settings / Editor / General / Editor tabs / Mark modified tabs with asterisk

42. Set path and enviroment variables Windows 7

Right-click the Computer icon and select Properties. 
Click the Advanced System Settings it on the left hand side.
In the System Properties window, click on the Advanced tab, then click the Environment Variables.
In the Environment Variables window highlight the Path variable in the "System variables" section and click the Edit button. 
Add or modify the path lines with the paths you want the computer to access. 

You can also set the path via the command prompt (search: cmd)
For example I set my path when installing nodejs like this.
If the path is: C:\Program Files\Nodejs do like this.

This string will be set the enviroment variable til you close prompt:
SET PATH=C:\Program Files\Nodejs;%PATH%

This will set the variable for good:
setx path "%path%;C:\Program Files\Nodejs"

35. Vagrant Box stopped working

I got this error after updating homestead.

My solution was to delete current version, installing it again. 
In my case when updating there where 2 box versions, I think this could have been the problem though im not sure.

Open command line and write: 
vagrant box list

to see what boxes you have. In my case this was the result:
laravel/homestead (virtualbox, 0.2.5)
laravel/homestead (virtualbox, 0.2.6)

To delete them you write:
vagrant box remove laravel/homestead --box-version 0.2.5
vagrant box remove laravel/homestead --box-version 0.2.6

After that cd to the homestead folder and write:
vagrant add laravel/homestead

32. CSS vertical align text - 23.06.2015

There are different ways to vertical align text, for example with table.

But I find this as the easiest way, add this to the div. you are trying to align.

In my case:

HTML:
<div class="single-activity">
    <span>Sprint</span>
</div>

CSS:
.single-activity {
height: 45px;
line-height: 45px;
vertical-align: middle;
}

29. Debugging/Freezing Bootstrap tooltips & popover
It can be hard to style certain element because they disappear when you try to click on them.

This is certainly the case with Bootstrap tooltips & popovers, when you try to inspect the element it will disappear.

My solution is to this problem is to make them visible with JavaScript, here is how:

$('[data-toggle="tooltip"]').tooltip('show');

OR

$('[data-toggle="popover"]').popover('show');

then through the developer tool navigate through the HTML to the popover element which in this case will not disappear.

or
setxkbmap dk
or
setxkbmap fo



To set it permanently you can do like this

sudo nano /etc/default/keyboard

This will appear:
 
XKBMODEL="pc105"
XKBLAYOUT="us"
XKBVARIANT=""
XKBOPTIONS=""

Then change XKBLAYOUT="**" to the prefered language in my case
XKBLAYOUT="dk"

19. Startcd PhpStorm-133.982/bin

./phpstorm.sh PHPstorm cli Ubuntu
I had problems starting PHPstorm as Ubuntu newbie, but figured it out by cd'ing to the bin directory in the PHP installation and starting the program by using ./ then a launch icon will be added to the desktop launch bar. Now you just right click the the PHPstorm icon a press "lock to launcher"

cd PhpStorm-133.982/bin

./phpstorm.sh 

if you want to start it from home, then:

./PhpStorm-133.982/bin/phpstorm.sh

and to make an alias type this in the terminal;

sudo nano ~/.bashrc

Then usually i go to the bottom the file and write something like this:

#CUSTOM ALIASES - JOHN
alias storm='./PhpStorm-139.1348/bin/phpstorm.sh'
alias phpstorm='./PhpStorm-139.1348/bin/phpstorm.sh'

Then save with:
CTRL+O (then press enter)
CTRL+X (to exit the document)

Then you need to reopen the terminal or just open a new terminal to get it working.

Create a new stylesheet and name it checkout.scss.liquid.

And add the changes in there worked very well for me.

6. Accessing illegal name properties from PHP Objects

I quite a long time to figure this one out.

I had a json decoded object where the object keys had some illegal characters "this-is-the-illegal-string".

This mean that the usual way will not work.

$array = ['hello' => 'John', 'hello-world' => 'John'];
$objext = (object)$array;
echo $object->['hello-world']; // This does not work

The solution is to use curly braces
echo $object->{'hello-world'}; // This works

5. Express params

I just started using Express and had some problems on how to use params to display pages "blog" pages.

app.get('/notes/:note', function(req, res){

    var notes = require(__dirname + '/pages/content/notes.json');

    res.render(__dirname + '/pages/note', { note: note. [req.params.note]});	

});

You will notice that I use the :note after the path /notes/:note

This will catch the unknown params that are added to the path.

You can use this string/value with req.param.note

Note can ofcourse be what ever you want forexample :bla
then you would use req.param.bla to get the value.

----

4. Relative CSS link

I typical mistake is to make CSS links relative by not using / at the start of the link.
